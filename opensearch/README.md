# How to use
### Prerequisites:
- Installation of Docker compose
### Starting up the local Docker cluster
- Start the cluster with `docker compose up -d` 

# Important information
- The current version of this setup is configured without security for local development, such that an initial prototype pipeline may be set up and demonstrated. In order to secure OpenSearch, please follow the guidelines provided by the creators of OpenSearch (e.g. [these guidelines](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/getting-started/quickstart/#set-up-a-cluster-with-security-recommended-for-most-use-cases) on setting up a Docker cluster "with security") as well as common security best practices (e.g. use and proper configuration of a firewall).
